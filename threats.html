        <ul class="threat-list">
            <li><b>Poaching:</b> Tigers are hunted illegally for their body parts, which are used in traditional medicine and other purposes.</li>

        <img src="images/habitat.png" alt="Habitat Loss" class="threat-image">
        <ul class="threat-list">
            <li><b>Habitat Loss:</b> Destruction of forests and grasslands for agriculture, development, and other purposes reduces tiger habitat.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="threat-container">
        <img src="images/conflict.png" alt="Human-Wildlife Conflict" class="threat-image">
        <li class="threat-list"><b>Human-Wildlife Conflict:</b> As human populations grow, conflicts arise when tigers compete with humans for resources or prey on livestock.</li>
